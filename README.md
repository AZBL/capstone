# PrimeCare

## Project Overview
PrimeCare is a fictional medical practice website, developed as a portfolio project to showcase full-stack development skills. It's important to note that this website is not intended for real-world medical use. The backend is built using Python and Flask, with a Postgres database managed by SQLAlchemy and hosted on ElephantSQL. The frontend is built with React and styled with pure CSS.

## Features

* **User Account Creation:** Users can register as "patients" to access personalized functionalities.
* **Patient Portal:** Allows patients to input, edit, and manage their medical information, including medications, medical conditions, surgical history, and allergies.
* **Messaging System:** Enables patients to communicate with staff members (medical providers) through a threaded messaging interface. 
* **Admin/Staff Privileges:** Designated users can view and edit patient information and search for and communicate with all registered patients.

## Tech Stack
* **Backend:** Python, Flask, hosted on Render
* **Database:** PostgresSQL, SQLAlchemy, hosted on ElephantSQL
* **Frontend:** React, hosted on Vercel
* **Styling:** CSS

## Usage
* **Accessing the Website:** Visit the hosted version: [PrimeCare](https://primecare.vercel.app)
* **Account Creation:** Find ‘Login’ in the Navbar, then choose ‘Sign Up’ or ‘Sign In’ (use a fictional email address).
* **Patient Portal:** Once logged in, patients can access their profile to manage their medical information or navigate to messages.
* **Messaging:** In the messages section, patients can search for and message staff members, whose names are available on the staff page.
* Of note, this site was made using free services. Due to this, some speed is sacrificed, and you might notice a cold start as the server goes idle after 15 minutes of inactivity. 

## Contribution
This project is a portfolio piece and is not intended for real-world medical application. Contributions to improve the codebase or enhance features are welcome.
